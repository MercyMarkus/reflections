When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repo when there are multiple contributors to the project (e.g Open source progects, team work)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually is advantageous cause you can easily keep track of changes to your code base instead of having git do it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork: this is cloning a copy of an existing repo you currently dont have access to in order to make changes to it.
    Clone: this is a copy of any repository on github
    Branches: this isa copy of an existing repo with more or less features.This is used more often in the local repository, it could be used to work on several sections of the repo at the same time without affecting the main code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
